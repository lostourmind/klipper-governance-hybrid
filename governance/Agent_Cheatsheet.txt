AGENT CHEATSHEET â€“ Validation & Gating

- Canary-first: patch ONE macro; stop and wait for 'promote' after a clean run.
- Mass-edit gate: show diffs; require 'promote' approval.
- Multi-attempt throttle: after 2 failed tries on same error, HALT; request context lines.
- Rollback checkpoint: save configs/.checkpoints/printer.cfg.ckpt.<DATE> before multi-line patches.
- RESPOND MSG only; no semicolons or [] inside messages; indent under gcode:; avoid M118 unless requested.
